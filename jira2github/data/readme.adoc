= Jira export

Please put an XML file here and reference it in `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.Client.main()`.

The file should be an XML export from Issues page of Jira project.
I've prepared a JAXB model for XML having a root element like this:
----
<rss version="0.92">
----

Replacements:
----
&quotquot; -> &quot;
&quot; -> &quot;
&ququot; -> &quot;
&quoquot; -> &quot;
&gtgt; -> &gt;
&aapos; -> &apos;
&llt; -> &lt;
&lt;lt; -> &lt;
�� -> :wink:

== What has to be migrated

See https://spring.io/blog/2019/01/15/spring-framework-s-migration-from-jira-to-github-issues for inspiration

* Jira links are tough, as they require 2 passes for the migration
* subtasks need a link in bottom-section of the issue
* attachments are already handled, but point to Jira
* Spring converts some Jira fields to GH labels:
** issue type -> `type: *`
** status -> `status: *`
** resolution -> `status: *`
** component -> `in: *`
* markup - unquoted code blocks (like XML) should be quoted, to at least display XML markup - no need to wrap inside 3xbacktics.
* `@` mentions should be quoted
* finally, it'd be great to add "last comments" to Jira issues, pointing back to Github

== Tool usage

First we need an exported XML with all Jira issues - I get it using Jira UI, by going to e.g., https://ops4j1.jira.com/issues/?jql=project+%3D+PAXLOGGING+ORDER+BY+status+DESC%2C+priority+DESC&mode=hide and clicking Export -> Export XML.

Before any issue may be imported to Github, target Github project needs some configuration.

Relevant `versions.properties`, `types.properties`, `components.properties`, `resolutions.properties`, `links.properties` and `users.properties` may be created using tests from `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.ParseTest`

* Github labels that represent Jira statuses, resolutions, issue types and components - this is done using `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.GithubLabelCreator`
* Github milestones that represent Jira versions.
** `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.JiraVersionExporter` copies the versions from Jira to Github
** `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.GithubMilestoneExporter` then prints a property-file formatted mapping of Jira versions to Github milestone numbers - this mapping has to be added to `etc/versions.properties`

Finally Jira issues may be copied to Github using `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.GithubIssueImporter` - this is the most important part.

`org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.GithubIssueExporter` gets back the Github issues and prints property-file formatted mapping of Jira issue keys to Github issue ids, which has to be added to `etc/issues.properties`.

`org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.JiraCommentCreator` uses `etc/issues.properties` to add _last comments_ to relevant Jira issues.

`org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.ParseTest.printMarkdownForReferences()` can be used to check if there are links related to projects which were not imported yet.

And really finally, `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.GithubIssueLinker` is using the Jira-exported XML file again, together with `etc/issues.properties`, `etc/links.properties` and `etc/projects.properties` to update body of Github issues and set issue references.
