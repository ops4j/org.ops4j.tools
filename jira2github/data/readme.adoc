= Jira export

Please put an XML file here and reference it in `org.ops4j.tools.jira2github.client.Client.main()`.

The file should be an XML export from Issues page of Jira project.
I've prepared a JAXB model for XML having a root element like this:
----
<rss version="0.92">
----

Replacements:
----
&quotquot; -> &quot;
&qquot; -> &quot;
&ququot; -> &quot;
&quoquot; -> &quot;
&gtgt; -> &gt;
&aapos; -> &apos;
&llt; -> &lt;
&lt;lt; -> &lt;
----

== What has to be migrated

See https://spring.io/blog/2019/01/15/spring-framework-s-migration-from-jira-to-github-issues for inspiration

* Jira links are tough, as they require 2 passes for the migration
* subtasks need a link in bottom-section of the issue
* attachments are already handled, but point to Jira
* Spring converts some Jira fields to GH labels:
** issue type -> `type: *`
** status -> `status: *`
** resolution -> `status: *`
** component -> `in: *`
* markup - unquoted code blocks (like XML) should be quoted
* `@` mentions should be quoted
* finally, it'd be great to add "last comments" to Jira issues, pointing back to Github
